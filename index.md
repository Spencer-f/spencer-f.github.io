# Hello World!

This is a blog about games. I write about board games, video games, and roleplaying games. I cover game design, game writing, and game reviews.

## About Me
I don't know much about coding, and am testing this project from scratch. If you know how I can make a proper title page, shoot me an email at spencer.flash@gmail.com
