# Hello World!

This is a blog about games. I write about board games, video games, and roleplaying games. I cover game design, game writing, and game reviews.

## About Me
I don't know much about coding, and am testing this project from scratch. If you know how I can make a proper title page, shoot me an email at spencer.flash@gmail.com

## My Top 5 Games of All Time

Tricky question! But I'd have to say the following:

1.  Dwarf Fortress
2.  Hotline Miami
3.  Rimworld
4.  Children of the Nile
5.  Crusader Kings 3
